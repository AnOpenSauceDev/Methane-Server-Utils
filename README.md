## Methane Server Utilities
### Tools to help manage [Methane](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod) on clients.

Methane Server Utils allows server admins to override settings for methane on the client, either by suggesting changes, or forcefully switching them when playing on the server. Clients without Methane can join as well, but this requires `forceMethane` to be `false` (off by default).

all configuration is stored as individual gamerules, so anyone with operator can change them.


Contributions are welcome, but please keep any code contributions version-independent.
This mod should only be on the server, and in this current state compatability has not been tested with other mods (should be fine anyways).

This is still a Work-In-Progress.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This is **NOT** a server moderation tool. Anyone can easily make their own fork of Methane to circumvent this if they have any knowledge of programming.
